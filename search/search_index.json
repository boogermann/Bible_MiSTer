C 1 2 3 4 5 #include stdio.h int main ( void ) { printf ( Hello world! \\n ); } Specific lines can be highlighted by passing the line numbers to the hl_lines argument placed right after the language identifier. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 ```python hl_lines= 3 4 Bubble sort def bubble_sort(items): for i in range(len(items)): for j in range(len(items) - 1 - i): if items[j] items[j + 1]: items[j], items[j + 1] = items[j + 1], items[j] ``` 1 2 3 4 5 6 Bubble sort def bubble_sort ( items ): for i in range ( len ( items )): for j in range ( len ( items ) - 1 - i ): if items [ j ] items [ j + 1 ]: items [ j ], items [ j + 1 ] = items [ j + 1 ], items [ j ] Abbreviations Abbreviations are defined as an extra paragraph mostly at the end of the document: 1 2 3 4 5 The HTML specification is maintained by the W3C. _[HTML]: Hyper Text Markup Language _[W3C]: World Wide Web Consortium This will be rendered with a tooltip on each occurrence of this words: The HTML specification is maintained by the W3C. _[HTML]: Hyper Text Markup Language _[W3C]: World Wide Web Consortium Combined with the later described includes it is also possible to place all abbreviations in a single file and include it at the end of each page. Footnotes The Footnote syntax follows the generally accepted syntax of the Markdown community. You add the footnote using [^1] with the correct number and define the content of this footnote later: 1 2 3 4 Footnotes[^1] have a label[^@#$%] and the footnote s content. [^1]: This is a footnote content. [^@#$%]: A footnote on the label: @#\\$% . This will look like: Footnotes 1 have a label 2 and the footnote s content. A footnote label must start with a caret ^ and may contain any inline text (including spaces) between a set of square brackets [] . Only the first caret has any special meaning. A footnote content must start with the label followed by a colon and at least one space. The label used to define the content must exactly match the label used in the body (including capitalization and white space). The content would then follow the label either on the same line or on the next line. The content may contain multiple lines, paragraphs, code blocks, blockquotes and most any other markdown syntax. The additional lines must be indented one level (four spaces or one tab). 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 [^1]: The first paragraph of the definition. Paragraph two of the definition. A blockquote with multiple lines. a code block A final paragraph. Include It is possible to include other markdown with a simple statement: 1 { !.gitignore!} No space after first curly brace to work! This statement will be replaced by the contents of the given file. The include extension will work recursively, so any included files within will also be included. This replacement is done prior to any other Markdown processing, so any Markdown syntax that you want can be used within your included files. The file path is relative to the project base (there mkdocs is been executed). Attributes Using attributes it is possible to set the various HTML element s attributes for output. An example attribute list might look like this: 1 {: #someid .someclass somekey= some value } This shows the possible definitions: A word which starts with # will set the id of an element. A word which starts with . will be added to the list of classes assigned to an element. A key/value pair somekey='some value' will assign that pair to the element. This can be set on block level elements if defined on the last line of the block by itself. 1 2 This is a paragraph. {: #an_id .a_class } The one exception is headers, as they are only ever allowed on one line. So there you neet to write: 1 ### A hash style header ### {: #hash } If used on inline elements the attributes are defined immediately after the element without any separation: 1 [link](http://example.com){: class= foo bar title= Some title! } If classes are used you may define them in an additional CSS file. Further reading MkDocs Homepage Markdown Syntax GitHub Markdown Keys Overview Keys is an extension to make entering and styling keyboard key presses easier. Syntactically, Keys is built around the + symbol. A key or combination of key presses is surrounded by ++ with each key press separated with a single + . Keys Example 1 ++ctrl+alt+delete++ Ctrl + Alt + Del . Formatting By default, Keys outputs keys in the form (separator span s will be omitted if a separator is not provided via the options ): 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 span class = keys kbd class = key-ctrl Ctrl / kbd span + / span kbd class = key-alt Alt / kbd span + / span kbd class = key-delete Delete / kbd / span Notice the wrapper span has the class keys applied to it. This is so you can target it or the elements under it with CSS. Each recognized key press has its own special key class assigned to it in the form key- key name . These individual key classes are great if you want to show special modifier key symbols before the key text (which is done in this documentation). The wrapper keys class can be customized with options, and the individual key classes are generated from the key-map index . If you would like to generate a key which isn t in the key index, you can extend the key map via a special option . But if you don t need a key with a special class generated, or you need a way to quickly enter a one time special key, you can just insert it directly by quoting the text you want displayed instead of a key name. You can also enter HTML entities if desired. Quoted Example 1 2 3 ++ctrl+alt+ My Special Key ++ ++cmd+alt+ Uuml; ++ Ctrl + Alt + My Special Key Cmd + Alt + \u00dc Strict KBD Output According to HTML5 spec on kbd , a literal key input, is represented by a kbd wrapped the other kbd s: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 kbd class = keys kbd class = key-ctrl Ctrl / kbd span + / span kbd class = key-alt Alt / kbd span + / span kbd class = key-delete Delete / kbd / kbd This is not how many people traditionally use kbd s for key inputs, but if you are a stickler for rules, you can enable the strict option to use a more proper format. Key-Map Index By default, Keys provides a key-map index for English US keyboards. The key-map index is a dictionary that provides all supported key names (which are used as the class in output class key- name ) with their corresponding display text. There is also a separate alias dictionary which maps some aliases to entries in the key-map index. Alphanumeric and Space Keys Name Display Aliases 0 0 1 1 2 2 3 3 4 4 5 5 6 6 7 7 8 8 9 9 a A b B c C d D e E f F g G h H i I j J k K l L m M n N o O p P q Q r R s S t T u U v V w W x X y Y z Z space Space spc Punctuation Keys Name Display Aliases backslash \\ bar | pipe brace-left { open-brace brace-right } close-bracket bracket-left [ open-bracket bracket-right ] close-brace colon : comma , double-quote \" dblquote equal = exclam ! exclamation grave ` grave-accent greater greater-than , gt less less-than , lt minus - hyphen period . plus + question ? question-mark semicolon ; single-quote ' slash / tilde ~ underscore _ Navigation Keys Name Display Aliases arrow-up Up up arrow-down Down down arrow-left Left left arrow-right Right right page-up Page Up prior , page-up , pg-up page-down Page Down next , page-dn , pg-dn home Home end End tab Tab tabulator Editing Keys Name Display Aliases backspace Backspace back , bksp delete Del del insert Ins ins Action Keys Name Display Aliases break Break cancel caps-lock Caps Lock capital , cplk clear Clear clr eject Eject enter Enter return escape Esc esc help Help print-screen Print Screen prtsc scroll-lock Scroll Lock scroll Numeric Keypad Keys Name Display Aliases num0 Num 0 num1 Num 1 num2 Num 2 num3 Num 3 num4 Num 4 num5 Num 5 num6 Num 6 num7 Num 7 num8 Num 8 num9 Num 9 num-asterisk Num * multiply num-clear Num Clear num-delete Num Del num-del num-equal Num = num-lock Num Lock numlk , numlock num-minus Num - subtract num-plus Num + add num-separator Num . decimal , separator num-slash Num / divide num-enter Num Enter Modifier keys Name Display Aliases alt Alt menu command Cmd cmd control Ctrl ctrl function Fn fn left-alt Left Alt lalt , left-menu , lmenu left-control Left Ctrl lcontrol , lctrl , left-ctrl left-shift Left Shift lshift left-windows Left Win left-win , lwin meta Meta option Option opt right-alt Right Alt ralt , right-menu , rmenu right-control Right Ctrl rcontrol , rctrl , right-ctrl right-shift Right Shift rshift right-windows Right Win right-win , rwin shift Shift windows Win win Function keys Name Display Aliases f1 F1 f2 F2 f3 F3 f4 F4 f5 F5 f6 F6 f7 F7 f8 F8 f9 F9 f10 F10 f11 F11 f12 F12 f13 F13 f14 F14 f15 F15 f16 F16 f17 F17 f18 F18 f19 F19 f20 F20 f21 F21 f22 F22 f23 F23 f24 F24 Extra Keys Name Display Aliases backtab Back Tab bktab browser-back Browser Back browser-favorites Browser Favor favorites browser-forward Browser Forward forward browser-home Browser Home browser-refresh Browser Refresh refresh browser-search Browser Search search browser-stop Browser Stop copy Copy context-menu Context Menu apps mail Mail launch-mail media Media launch-media media-next-track Next Track next-track media-pause Pause pause media-play Play play media-play-pause Play/Pause play-pause media-prev-track Previous Track prev-track media-stop Stop stop print Print reset Reset select Select sleep Sleep volume-down Volume Down vol-down volume-mute Mute mute volume-up Volume Up vol-up zoom Zoom Mouse Name Display Aliases left-button Left Button lbutton middle-button Middle Button mbutton right-button Right Button rbutton x-button1 X Button 1 xbutton1 x-button2 X Button 2 xbutton2 Extending/Modifying Key-Map Index If you want to add additional keys, or override text of existing keys, you can feed in your keys via the key_map option. The key_map parameter takes a simple dictionary with key names that are represented by lowercase alphanumeric characters and hyphens ( - ). The values of the dictionary represent the the text that is displayed for the key in the HTML output. So if you wanted to add a custom key, you could do this: { custom : Custom Key } . If you wanted to override the output of the option key and change it from Option to Opt , you could do this: { option : Opt } . Options Option Type Default Description separator string + Define a separator. strict bool False Use strict HTML5 output for keyboard key input. class string keys Defines a class(es) to apply to the HTML wrapper element. camel_case bool False Allow the use of camel case for key names PgUp pg-up . key_map dict {} Add additional keys to the key-map index or override output of existing outputs.

This is so you can target it or the elements under it with CSS. Each recognized key press has its own special key class assigned to it in the form key- key name . These individual key classes are great if you want to show special modifier key symbols before the key text (which is done in this documentation). The wrapper keys class can be customized with options, and the individual key classes are generated from the key-map index . If you would like to generate a key which isn t in the key index, you can extend the key map via a special option . But if you don t need a key with a special class generated, or you need a way to quickly enter a one time special key, you can just insert it directly by quoting the text you want displayed instead of a key name. You can also enter HTML entities if desired.

When will MiSTer support cartridges? MiSTer will never use physical cartridges. Not only is it outside the scope of the project which aims to replace the need for having real hardware, it is physically very impractical/impossible given the number of GPIO pins available from the FPGA. Does MiSTer have lag? Short answer: No, not with a normal setup. Long answer: You may see some latency depending on your display, controller and settings. But they can all be tweaked to a large extent if that is important to you. In general, if you use a CRT and native peripherals like an original console, you will experience no additional latency compared to it. See here for a more detailed explanation. Any USB controller recommendations? Please refer to this page Can I use native controllers? Short answer: Yes. Long answer: Native controllers can be used with a USB adapter. There are a few specialized controllers that may not work as a regular gamepad (eg. Zapper), and for those it is possible to use a serial interface board (e.g. IO Board + SNAC). Native protocols via SNAC are currently supported for NES, SNES, and Genesis cores. Through this, a Zapper can be used with a CRT. Does MiSTer need an IO board? Short answer: No. Long answer: The IO board is optional, but offers some features that might be important to some users. Being an Input/Output (IO) device, it\u2019s primary function is to provide a native (like original hardware) video and audio signal to analog displays (CRTs) with zero lag (see FAQ 2 above) and audio devices via 3.5mm audio cable or optical (TOSLINK) output. Please note, HDMI video and audio will continue to function when using analog output. This dual output is especially useful for those who wish to capture/stream gameplay footage. The input side of the device refers to the serial port, which has the same physical appearance as a USB 3.0 port. It is not however, a true USB port, and does not support regular USB devices at all. See FAQ 4 above for more information on how you would use this part of the IO board. There are other small features of the IO board that serve minor purposes; please see this page for more information about them. Do I need a Hub Add-On Board? Short answer: No. Long answer: The USB Hub Addon Board can be considered a luxury item. An inexpensive OTG USB HUB from online markets will work fine for many people. The advantage of the addon board is that it physically integrates very cleanly and safely with the DE10 and it has seven powered USB ports which is plenty for almost any user. Users who want to use many or several power hungry USB devices will want to at least be sure to get a USB Hub that is externally powered so as not to overtax the DE10\u2019s power circuitry. Take care to pay attention to the DE10\u2019s rather delicate OTG USB port. Another advantage of the addon board is that it very securely attaches to this port. Corded OTG Hub users will want to be careful that this port is not stressed by a sudden jerk or a slow steady pull. Does my MiSTer need cooling? Short answer: Yes, at least a heatsink (passive cooling). Long answer: While it s fine for general operations, the DE-10 board\u2019s FPGA chip ideally requires a passive heatsink to avoid heat interfering with some of the more complex cores. 22mm x 22mm is the ideal heatsink size for this. Active cooling (a fan) is recommended for long term use. Some cores may present corruption/artifacts if the chip is not cooled with a fan. A 40mm diameter fan, powered from either the IO board or directly from one of the DE-10\u2019s GPIO pins, is the recommended type for this task. Typically this fan is mounted on the optional IO board, however it can also be mounted on a 3D-printed plate or hand-cut piece of plastic or cardboard if you do not need or have an IO board. Do I need an IO board to get analog video output to my CRT? Short answer: No. You can use an HDMI to VGA adapter to do it. Long answer: Use of an inexpensive HDMI to VGA adapter is supported in most cores. These dongles can easily be found in online markets by searching. I heard the DE10-Nano board uses subsidized components. Is MiSTer doomed if that stops? The DE10 Nano is broadly sold to universities and is available in larger supply than custom hardware made only for retro enthusiasts. In general, these development boards are manufactured and sold for a long time (the last generation DE1 board is still sold), so there is no reason to be concerned. Worst case, the work done in cores can be ported to other boards in the future. For now, the DE10-Nano remains the best and most cost-effective option, and MiSTer is a perfect fit for it as the boards are intended to introduce FPGA programming to a wider audience.","title":"FAQ"},{"location":"faq/#faq","text":"This page contains commonly asked questions and their answers.

time setup of the MiSTer system. It will guide you through the SD-card installation, help you update the MiSTer system files and shows you how to run a game on an example core (NES). Requirements You will need the following things to get everything started. Main Components 1 x Windows 10 ( or see this script ) for SD card creation under macOS and Linux 1 x DE10-nano board + 5V power supply 1 x Internet connection 1 x SD Card reader 1 x Micro SD Card with at least 2GB of capacity 1 x Monitor + HDMI cable 1 x USB-OTG (Micro USB) adapter + USB keyboard 1 x SDRAM Board (Optional) Check out the How to start and Input devices wiki pages for more information on the peripheral. Prepare the SD-card Download the latest SD card installer from here Insert your SD card into your card reader. Extract the release_201#####.rar file. Start MiSTer SD Card Utility.exe Make sure it says U-Boot + Linux + MiSTer in the Image field. - Newer versions of Mister SD card Utility will says Boot + Files in the Image field. Select your SD card in the Drive field. If you have inserted the SD card after starting the Installer, hit the Refresh button and your SD card should appear. Press Full Install and confirm the following Warning with Yes . All data on the SD card will be deleted! Make sure to backup the SD-card before you execute this! Confirm the successful installation with ok The Installer will open multiple windows which will ask you to format the drive. Don t format the drive! Press Cancel in all three windows. The SD card file explorer window will be opened twice, close one of them. The SD-card should contain the following three files / folder: If you see only the menu.rbf file, hit F5 on your keyboard or right click Refresh to refresh the window. You should see all three files now. The files you see are: * linux - Folder containing linux files * config - The configuration folder where various config files are placed automatically. Those files usually don t need any manual modifications. - This folder is no more created by newer version of SD Card Utility, but it will be created automatically by the MiSTer hardware at first run (you can manually create and populate it if you want) * menu.rbf - This is the actual MiSTer menu core, which you will see when you boot up the DE10-Nano board ( GitHub ). * MiSTer - MiSTer main firmware ( GitHub ) Update MiSTer files The SD-card installer might be older then the actual binary releases of the MiSTer firmware and the menu core. Therefore, we want to bring those files up to date. Go to the MiSTer-devel/Main_MiSTer Repository and download the most recent MiSTer_201##### firmware file on the bottom of the page. Rename the MiSTer_201##### file to MiSTer Copy the file over to your SD-card and override the old MiSTer file. Repeat this for the menu core file: Go to the MiSTer-devel/Menu_MiSTer repository and download the most recent menu_201#####.rbf core file on the bottom of the page. Rename menu_201#####.rbf to menu.rbf and override the old file on the SD card. Get a core We want to actually run a core like the NES or Amiga on our DE10-Nano FPGA board. Therefore, we have to copy a core .rbf file to the root of the SD-card. The sidebar on the right contains a list of MiSTer compatible cores. Check out the GitHub repository page of each core for specific information. The following description is a generic example based on the NES core, but it is applicable to most other cores. Click in the sidebar on Cores NES or go directly through this link to the MiSTer-devel/NES_MiSTer release folder. Download the lates NES_20######.rbf core file Copy the core file to the root of the SD Card. Leave the date in the filename. By this, you know which version you are actually using. Create a new folder and name it for example NES Games . Download a .nes ROM (Game) file and copy it into your NES Games folder. You have to google that by yourself Fire it up! Make sure the SDRAM-Board is attached to the GPIO header JP1 of the DE10-Nano (See SDRAM Wiki-Page for further instructions). Connect the board via HDMI to an monitor and via USB-OTG adapter to a keyboard. Do not connect the power supply yet. Remove the SD-card from your PC and insert it in the DE10-Nano board. Connect the power supply. This will turn on the DE10-Nano board. You will see the MiSTer menu on the monitor. You see in the menu the NES core we have copied to the SD Card. Hit the Enter key to start it. You will see a black screen. This is normal because no ROM is loaded yet. Press F12 to bring up the MiSTer menu. In order to run a game, select Load *.NES and hit Enter . This will bring up the SD-card root directory. Navigate into your NES Games folder and select the ROM you want to start and hit Enter .. Congratulation, you successfully started you first game on your MiSTer! Following steps To get the most out of your MiSTer don t forget to (at least) check out the following pages: - Configuration Files - Video Filters - Input devices Additional notes Once you ve installed Release_20180115 or later, you can install future updates on MiSTer without removing the SD card. It s done in 2 stages: 1) Copy everything from files folder of release to /media/fat using FTP client and then reboot MiSTer (use Left Shift + Left CTRL + Left Alt + Right Alt combination). 2) Log in via serial console or ssh and type updateboot then reboot again. Usually bootloader has none or little change and not always requires update. But for better experience it s advised to update the bootloader with every release. If somehow new version of Linux won t be able to boot with previous bootloader, then simply use SD Install Tool to update the bootloader ( Update Boot button). If you wish to organize the cores into directories rather than have them stored on the root directory, you will need to add an underscore in front of the directory name.","title":"How to Setup"},{"location":"getting-started/how-to-setup/#setting-up","text":"This is an essential guide for your first time setup of the MiSTer system.

MiSTer provides modern video output through HDMI (VGA and analog audio are still available via an optional daughter board). It s based on the Terasic DE10-nano board. Here are some improvements over the MiST board: The Hardware FPGA Device Intel Cyclone\u00ae V SE 5CSEBA6U23I7NDK device (110K LEs) Serial configuration device \u2013 EPCS64 (revision B2 or later) USB-Blaster II onboard for programming; JTAG Mode HDMI TX, compatible with DVI 1.0 and HDCP v1.4 2 push-buttons 4 slide switches 8 green user LEDs Three 50MHz clock sources from the clock generator Two 40-pin expansion headers One Arduino expansion header (Uno R3 compatibility), can be connected with Arduino shields One 10-pin Analog input expansion header (shared with Arduino Analog input) A/D converter, 4-pin SPI interface with FPGA Info Board is mass-produced by a large manufacturer and freely available for a relatively cheap price. HPS (Hard Processor System) 800MHz Dual-core ARM Cortex-A9 processor 1GB DDR3 SDRAM (32-bit data bus) 1 Gigabit Ethernet PHY with RJ45 connector USB OTG Port, USB Micro-AB connector Micro SD card socket Accelerometer (I2C interface + interrupt) UART to USB, USB Mini-B connector Warm reset button and cold reset button One user button and one user LED LTC 2x7 expansion header Due to a larger FPGA, bigger systems can be created. It s also possible to add more support from the ARM side. For example, TZX tape format can be parsed on ARM and then sent to FPGA. Firmware is not limited by code size or available RAM. It s even possible to emulate some parts of system through ARM that are not available in the FPGA (resulting in a so-called hybrid emulator). Tip MiSTer scales original video resolution to a standard HDMI resolution (usually 1280x720p60), so you don t need to look for some ancient monitor with VGA input supporting non-standard resolution and frame rates. For purists, VGA is still available, and it outputs original video resolution. How does it work? MiSTer adds several daughter boards to the original DE10-nano board. You don t need to install all boards. MiSTer starts from entry level as a bare DE10-nano board. With just one additional board (SDRAM), you will be able to use almost all cores. SDRAM board: (recommended expansion) This small board plugs into the GPIO0 connector of the DE10-nano board. Whilst the DE10-nano has fast DDR3 memory, it cannot be used to emulate a retro EDO DRAM due to a high latency and shared usage from the ARM side. This SDR SDRAM on a daughter board is required for most cores to emulate a retro memory module. I/O board: (optional expansion) This board plugs into the GPIO1 connector of the DE10-nano board. It provides a legacy VGA output (6 bits per component), analog audio (3.5mm phone jack), digital optical audio, buttons, and LEDs. This board is useful if you prefer VGA over HDMI or you want to put the MiSTer inside a case. This board also helps for core development; HDMI scaler code requires around twice as much time to compile, while compiling for VGA-only will speed up development. This board is not required to run most cores. RTC board: (optional expansion) This board is plugged into the LTC connector and provides a real-time clock (RTC). You still can have a real-time clock without the board if MiSTer is connected to Internet via Ethernet. Only two cores use this feature, so it is only for enthusiasts. USB hub board (optional expansion) This board adds a 7-port USB hub that sits under the main board. Schematics and Gerber files are available to download. Boards are considered DIY (do it yourself). There are no restrictions on how these boards are manufactured and sold, or by whom; any third party is welcome to manufacture and sell them. What is an FPGA anyways? FPGA stands for field-programmable gate array, essentially, an FPGA is a hardware circuit that a user can program to carry out one or more logical operations. Taken a step further, FPGAs are integrated circuits (ICs), which are sets of circuits on a chip (that\u2019s the \u201carray\u201d part). Those circuits, or arrays, are groups of programmable logic gates, memory, or other elements. With a standard chip, such as the CPU/GPU in your laptop, Arduino or Raspberry Pi the chip is fully baked. It can\u2019t be programmed; you get what you get. With these chips, a user can write software that loads onto a chip and executes functions. That software can later be replaced or deleted, but the hardware chip remains unchanged. With an FPGA, there is no chip. The user programs the hardware circuit or circuits. The programming can be a single, simple logic gate (an AND or OR function), or it can involve one or more complex functions, including functions that, together, act as a comprehensive multi-core processor. Why Use an FPGA? A typical potential user will eventually ask: Why do you need to use FPGA while other proven solutions exist, such as Raspberry Pi? There are debates about how to refer to the process of simulating real hardware using FPGA. Some people insist it s not emulation but rather true hardware replication , while any simulation using a traditional CPU should be referred to as emulation. I have my own opinion here. :) From my point of view, if the FPGA code is based on the circuitry of real hardware (along with the usual tweaks for FPGA compatibility), then it should be called replication. Anything else is emulation, since it uses different kinds of approximation to meet the same objectives. Currently, it s hard to find a core that can truly be called a replica \u2013 most cores are based on more-or-less functional recreations rather than true circuit recreation. The most widely used CPU cores \u2013 the Z80 (T80) and MC68000 (TG68K) \u2013 are pure functional emulations, not replications. So it s okay to call FPGA cores emulators, unless they are proven to be replicas. To go back to the original question, then, why FPGA, if it s also just emulation? Well, FPGA emulation is fundamentally different than emulation on a CPU. Traditional emulators on CPUs execute code sequentially. This is a tricky method of emulation because real hardware has many chips and all of them work in parallel. The CPU, video chip/logic, audio chip, memory arbiter \u2013 all of them are working at the same time. So a traditional emulator has to take care of all these parts and try to emulate the whole orchestra at the same time by quickly running from one chip to another. This requires a lot of CPU power to emulate even an old and slow retro computer. Sometimes even a modern CPU working at 100 times the speed of the retro computer is not enough, so the emulator has to use approximation, skip emulation of some less important parts, or assume some standard work of the emulated system without extraordinary usage. Let s take a well-known emulator, UAE, emulating an Amiga. On a Raspberry Pi 3, you can run some Amiga CPU benchmarks and get crazy numbers like 100 times the original 68000 processor. So you may assume you have an emulated Amiga that is 100 times faster than real one. No, you don t. If you run different kinds of demos or games, you will see the video stutters sometimes. For example, if you play the well-known State of The Art demo by Spaceballs, you will notice video stuttering at some points, while a real Amiga 600 with 1x CPU speed plays the whole demo very smoothly. This is how traditional emulators on Raspberry Pi work. FPGA emulation works very differently from traditional emulation on CPU. An FPGA is a large array of simple triggers and other logic \u2013 just like any other chip/CPU. The only difference is that specific chips/CPUs have these triggers and logic permanently connected, while FPGA allows you to connect them however you want. A special HDL (hardware description language) describes how to connect all these triggers/logic cells. Everything in FPGA works in parallel like in the original chips/devices. Thus, FPGA is pretty close to the original hardware. FPGA doesn t need high frequencies to emulate retro computers; it works at much lower frequencies than traditional emulators require. Since everything in FPGA works in parallel, it is no problem to handle any possible usage of the emulated system. Developers using FPGA usually concentrate on the specific part to make it work correctly \u2013 and it will work as it should in any possible scenario. In the same reference demo, State Of the Art, using FPGA emulation, you can see smooth video through the whole playback, as on the original hardware. You may want to ask, So why not make all emulators on FPGA then? The answer: FPGA programming is not so trivial. Every bit in FPGA works in parallel, so the developer needs to think in parallel as well :). What is trivial on CPU is not trivial on FPGA \u2013 although some parts that are trivial on FPGA cost a lot in CPU code. Linux? DE10 uses Linux for house-keeping duties such as loading data from the SD card. It may seem as if Linux will take considerable time to boot, but this isn t the case. The version used by MiSTer has been optimized to only take a couple of seconds to boot. Most monitors and TV require a longer time to lock on the video signal and start to display, so the result is that the MiSTer has an instant-on feel, like original hardware back in the day.","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"getting-started/introduction/#introduction","text":"MiSTer is a port of the well-known MiST project to a larger field-programmable gate array (FPGA) and faster ARM processor.

The author of this project and contributors are NOT affiliated with these vendors and do not derive any income from them. Please direct any inquiries or concerns about expansion hardware to relevant third parties. Board The heart and engine of the whole platform is the Terasic DE10-nano development board. You can buy it: Directly from Terasic Mouser Digikey Micro SD Card An 8GB Micro SD card is included with the kit, it can be reformatted to use with your MiSTer. Any MicroSD card 2GB and larger should work fine as well. Speed class doesn t affect it. USB connection It is recommended that you use a powered OTG USB hub with your DE10-nano board. The socket isn t very robust so it is better to avoid connecting and disconnecting too often. It is also not able to handle high current consumption, so any powered USB devices will need an external powered hub. It handles a keyboard and mouse fine, though. You have the following options: Micro USB OTG cable + USB 2.0 hub : USB 2.0 hub with external power might be a good idea both to eliminate OTG socket reliability issues and provide power to external devices. Some cheap ones on e-bay/aliexpress may be declared as full speed USB 2.0 but in fact work in USB low speed mode. Acceptable for keyboard, but better avoid them. OTG USB Hub : These hubs are designed to connect directly to micro-USB OTG port and require less inter-connections cables. Such HUBs are also available on e-bay/aliexpress. USB hub daughter board : You can assemble this board that provide 7 usb ports available to the MiSTer system. Optional part. Expansion boards Several cores require an external SDR SDRAM board expansion to work, since they require more accurate memory timings than the BRAM and DDR3 RAM integrated in the DE10-nano. As such it is strongly recommended that you build or buy an SDRAM board to use the MiSTer fully. There is also an I/O board to provide more capabilities like VGA output for old monitors, analog audio, optional audio out, and Buttons/LEDs for external connections to integrate into existing old computer cases.

The main heater in the chip is dual-core ARM producing a constant heat regardless the FPGA core. The version of chip on the board is industrial grade and basically supports up to 100C degrees, but for guaranteed long usage without degrading the characteristics it s highly advised to use the cooler. FPGA used in Terasic DE10-Nano board is approximately 21.5mm x 21.5mm. Ideal dimension of heatsink is 22mm x 22mm millimeters and it will cover all the FPGA. A 25mm x 25mm can be used but pay ATTENTION to nearby components, they must not touch the heatsink. The height of the heatsink should be no more than 10 mm if a I/O board is used because it could touch parts in the I/O board making short circuits. Active cooling Some large cores like ao486 and Minimig are sensitive to FPGA chip temperature and become unstable if it s hot. So active cooling, in addition to passive cooling, is required for better stability. Latests I/O BOARDS do have a place for a 40mm x 40mm fan. If you do not use any I/O boards then you can use bigger fans, but bear in mind that only 5V is available from Terasic DE 10 Nano board, so a 5V fan is required.

Extract the archive to the root of MiSTer SD card FAT partition. Desktop Linux is based on Ubuntu 16.04 with LXDE distributed by Terasic with DE10-nano board. It s light-weight linux. Frame buffer has been completely rewritten with configurable resolution and integrated scaler. Audio output is also implemented unlike original Terasic version. VGA and all MiSTer audio outputs are supported. How it works? If core (rbf file) has the text file with the same name, then it means MiSTer will reboot and will use additional sets of u-boot commands from that txt file. That s how alternative kernel and linux image are used. It s not really tied to Linux only. If there will be other cores requiring special code on ARM side, then it will be run the same way. Even bare-metal projects can be loaded. One RBF file can have several configs using RBF as a base name + additional suffix. Several configs are included in release. Video card emulated in FPGA has 2 resolutions: * HDMI resolution comes from the the board to HDMI and VGA. * Linux resolution which Linux sees. It will be boxed and then up/down scaled to HDMI resolution. Thus Linux may have any resolutions up to 1920x1080, including non-standard ones. All video parameters are passed as kernel parameters in config file (txt). Parameters are: * altvipfb.video_mode - video mode number. Same as in MiSTer.ini (including custom modes, new format). Default is 1280x720 @60 * altvipfb.aspect - set to 0 if you want to stretch Linux resolution to full screen. By default aspect=1. If bgwidth or bgheight are set, then aspect ratio is ignored in favor to explicit box dimensions. * altvipfb.width - horizontal resolution for Linux. Default is the same as HDMI resolution width. * altvipfb.height - vertical resolution for Linux. Default is the same as HDMI resolution height. * altvipfb.format - color format. Default is 8888 i.e. 32bit. Other possible values are 565 and 1555 - both are 16bit colors. 565 is good alternative to 8888. It requires 2 times less memory and works faster than 32bit. * altvipfb.bgr - set to 1 if you want to swap R and B components. Usually you don t need to use this parameter. Default is 0. * altvipfb.bgwidth - box width. Default is the same as width. * altvipfb.bgheight - box height. Default is the same as height. Box resolution is added around Linux resolution before up/down scaling. It s used to add horizontal/vertical fields in order to correct aspect ratio - i.e. letterboxing. By default Linux resolution will be boxed automatically, so bgwidth/bgheight usually are not required. Check supplied config files to see how to use the parameters. Leave other text as-is if you don t know what it does. Text file uses Linux line endings, so you need to use compatible text editor if you edit it on Windows PC. Note: Linux image is mounted as read-write, so avoid from turning off or reset without proper shutdown! I suggest to choose Reboot instead of Shutdown so MiSTer will reboot into MiSTer menu where you can simply turn off the power. DE10-nano board has no power off feature, so if you choose Shutdown it will end by black screen and it will be hard to tell if shutdown procedure is finished already or not.

James-F has created a number of curves that are included in the Gamma folder of this repository. The MiSTer Filters and Gamma Github repository is here and all of the Interpolation Filters that have been created can be found here . Tip If you use MiSTer you should be using a custom filter for upscaling if you want high quality without uneven scaling and shimmering during scrolling. As of November 2018, MiSTer can use custom filter coefficients to define the interpolation used for scaling over the HDMI output (and VGA too with a mister.ini option). This allows MiSTer to scale images using well-known image scaling algorithms such as bicubic or lanczos scaling as well as other scaling methods better suited to scaling pixel graphics. Special effects such as scanlines and lcd effects are also possible. How to use filter coefficients and gamma tables To use any of the pre-made filter coefficients (or your own) you need: An updated version of MiSTer ( Main_MiSTer ). The first release with support was MiSTer_20181116. A supported core. Nearly all cores should have support now, but some Arcade Cores still have not been updated to the newer MiSTer framework as of November 2019. Filters. Filters are text files containing the coefficients for a specific interpolation method. All filters must go in the Filters directory on your MiSTer SD card. The most common way to obtain a set of filters is to run the MiSTer updater script (if your MiSTer has network access). You can also download a release ZIP file from this repository or download a copy of this repository and copy the Filters folder over to your SD card by hand. Filter Releases are here: MiSTer Filters/Gamma Release Folder Gamma. Gamma tables are text files containing the R,G,B entries of a gamma lookup table. All gamma LUTs must go in the Gamma directory on your MiSTer SD card. You can obtain gamma tables in the same way as the filters: either using the MiSTer updater script or by copying the Gamma folder from this repository over to your SD card by hand. Once you have updated MiSTer and Cores and your filter/gamma coefficients in the right place you simply Start a supported core Go to page 2 of the core s OSD menu and under HDMI Scaler: change the option from Filter - Internal to Filter - Custom The option below Filter - Custom should now be enabled and will allow you to choose your filter from the files in your /Filters folder. Gamma Tables are implemented the same way and are just below the Filters options on page 2 of the OSD. If you have Filters settings but not Gamma settings then you re using a core that does not yet support Gamma LUTs. How do the filters look like The Filters folder contains a set of recommended filters for general use. There are samples in the Samples folder of this repository. View these images at full size to make a proper evaluation. Interpolation (Sharp) Scanlines (Sharp) Scanlines (Soft) LCD Effect (Monochrome) LCD Effect (Color) Vertical Scanlines (Soft) Technical Information The commercial VIP scaler implements a generic 4 tap, 16 phase polyphase filter. The open source ASCAL scaler that MiSTer uses now implements the same type of filter for scaling. Details are on page 189 of the VIP scaler docs here: Intel VIP Scaler Doc The Zipcores Application Notes pdf explains the workings of the filter much better than the ALtera/Intel docs: Zipcores Application Notes Most of the currently available filter coefficients were generated with the Matlab code here: https://github.com/ghogan42/Filter-Coefficients-For-MiSTer Tips for understanding the MiSTer filter coefficient text files There are separate coefficients for horizontal and vertical scaling. Each row of the Filter Text File list the coefficients for taps T0, T1, T2, T3 for a paricular phase. The first row is phase 0 and corresponds to the center of tap T1. The ninth row is phase 8 and corresponds to the halfway point between T1 and T2 (so it s the pixel edge between T1 and T2). Then last row is phase 15 and corresponds to 15/16 th of the way from T1 to T2 (so one phase before the center T2).

Use Interpolation (Sharp) and SNES Interpolation (Sharp) if you don t care for scanlines and just want good interpolation. But all of the filters Filters root are Recommended Filters . So Interpolation (Sharp), Scanlines (Sharp), Scanlines (Soft), Vertical Scanlines (Sharp), Vertical Scanlines (Soft), LCD (Monochrome), and LCD (Color) are good defaults for most MiSTer cores. Why would I want to use custom filter coefficients? The default scaling algorithm of MiSTer is Nearest Neighbor/Lanczos and is not ideal for upscaling pixel graphics. The filters allow much better looking scaling and special effects such as scanlines. Doesn t MiSTer already have scanlines through the Scandoubler FX option in the OSD? Yes, but the scanlines available with Scandoubler FX are aligned to the scandoubled image and the scanlines through the filter coefficients are aligned to the original pixels in the scanline. So you achieve better scanlines with filter coefficients in most cases. Where do I get sets of Filter Coefficients or Gamma LUTs? Here. Or the update script which will get them from here. This is the official place to get these filters as of Dec 03, 2018 Why are some filters labeled SNES ? MiSTer s SNES core outputs a 512 pixel wide image even when the SNES is in it s 256 pixel wide mode. This makes the horizontal interpolation too sharp. The SNES specific filters take this into account. What do some filters have NN appended to the name? Some people set MiSTer to scale to do integer scaling for the vertical upscaling (by setting vscale_mode=1 in mister.ini). If you do this you can use the NN filters that only enable interpolation for horizontal scaling. Where is a filter that does XXXXX? Check the subfolders for many filters. Only a few are in the Filters root folder to make choosing a filter easier for newbies and non-technical people. But there are many more to choose from.","title":"Video Filters"},{"location":"getting-started/extras/video-filters/#video-filters","text":"As of November 2019 this github also contains Gamma Lookup Tables to allow MiSTer apply a gamma curves to cores with an updated framework. James-F has created a number of curves that are included in the Gamma folder of this repository. The MiSTer Filters and Gamma Github repository is here and all of the Interpolation Filters that have been created can be found here . Tip If you use MiSTer you should be using a custom filter for upscaling if you want high quality without uneven scaling and shimmering during scrolling. As of November 2018, MiSTer can use custom filter coefficients to define the interpolation used for scaling over the HDMI output (and VGA too with a mister.ini option). This allows MiSTer to scale images using well-known image scaling algorithms such as bicubic or lanczos scaling as well as other scaling methods better suited to scaling pixel graphics. Special effects such as scanlines and lcd effects are also possible.","title":"Video Filters"},{"location":"getting-started/extras/video-filters/#how-to-use-filter-coefficients-and-gamma-tables","text":"To use any of the pre-made filter coefficients (or your own) you need: An updated version of MiSTer ( Main_MiSTer ).

Nearly all cores should have support now, but some Arcade Cores still have not been updated to the newer MiSTer framework as of November 2019. Filters. Filters are text files containing the coefficients for a specific interpolation method. All filters must go in the Filters directory on your MiSTer SD card. The most common way to obtain a set of filters is to run the MiSTer updater script (if your MiSTer has network access). You can also download a release ZIP file from this repository or download a copy of this repository and copy the Filters folder over to your SD card by hand. Filter Releases are here: MiSTer Filters/Gamma Release Folder Gamma. Gamma tables are text files containing the R,G,B entries of a gamma lookup table. All gamma LUTs must go in the Gamma directory on your MiSTer SD card. You can obtain gamma tables in the same way as the filters: either using the MiSTer updater script or by copying the Gamma folder from this repository over to your SD card by hand. Once you have updated MiSTer and Cores and your filter/gamma coefficients in the right place you simply Start a supported core Go to page 2 of the core s OSD menu and under HDMI Scaler: change the option from Filter - Internal to Filter - Custom The option below Filter - Custom should now be enabled and will allow you to choose your filter from the files in your /Filters folder.

See Keyboard for details Mouse MiSTer supports up to 3 buttons (exact number of mouse buttons is core-dependent). Most USB wired and wireless mice, trackballs and touchpads will work. Joystick and gamepads MiSTer has a powerful set of features for USB gaming controllers: Up to 6 player support Button mapping options Auto Fire Mouse emulation from joystick Debugging options Joystick player assignment Up to 6 player controllers are supported (depending on core): * After a core starts, press a button on any connected controller to make it the P1 gamepad/joystick * Press a button on a second controller to make it the P2 joystick (if supported by core) * Keep going for assigning P3, P4, etc. * To remap, just clear all assignments by restarting the core. USB Joystick mapping USB joysticks, gamepads, and keyboards need to be defined in the central menu before use in any core. Please refer to Main Joystick Mapping Auto fire Any defined button (except d-pad) supports auto fire feature. To activate auto fire, press and keep desired button and then quickly press the button defined as BUTTON OSD (for joystick) or KBD TOGGLE (for keyboard). To deactivate auto fire, repeat the the same procedure. Auto fire provides 50ms-1000ms rates. To choose the speed, press and keep one of direction on d-pad and then quickly press the button defined as BUTTON OSD (for joystick) or KBD TOGGLE (for keyboard).

More below. MiSTer Gamepad The first step is to teach MiSTer to recognize your physical controller. This is done in the menu shown at startup. After plugging a keyboard, press F12 to show system settings and select Define joystick buttons MiSTer will then ask you to assign several buttons to your controller: * Test the D-Pad and analog sticks (if any) * Four face buttons and two shoulder buttons * Start and Select * OSD button or 2-button combo (to use instead of F12 on the keyboard) * A few extra buttons for advanced functions (more below) Here is a conceptual representation of the MiSTer Gamepad: MiSTer internally recognizes more buttons (and two analogue sticks), but the above is the minimum required to work on most cores. You can also ignore the analogue stick as long as you do not use the few cores that require it (e.g. Apple II, Atari 5200). From USB hardware to MiSTer Gamepad This step is exclusively handled in the main startup menu. You can override it by re-doing a mapping from inside a core. MiSTer uses USB HID to handle controllers. Each controller is recognized by a unique USB ID (VID:PID) and declares what it can do (does it have d-pad? how many buttons?). This information does not contain any physical information (which button is A , where it is located ) and you may want to decide which buttons to specifically assign for each function. That is where you come in. MiSTer will ask you to: * Test D-Pad and analogue sticks (effectively a joystick calibration) * Choose what to use for directions (can be D-Pad, any analogue stick, or even buttons) Then it will ask you to assing: * A, B, X, Y, L, R buttons to the MiSTer gamepad (see image above) * Start and Select buttons * A button or a 2-button combo to open the OSD And finally it will ask to select: * Alternative directions (also used for mouse emulation) * Controller buttons to use as mouse buttons (left, right, middle) * Button to turn on mouse emu (and to use as sniper mouse mode) See below for a more technical description of each step. During the mapping you can press: * ESC to cancel the mapping operation and return to menu * SPACE to skip a button (that button will remain undefined) * ENTER to end the mapping without mapping any further buttons (keeps maps done so far) The screen will also display the VID:PID (the USB ID) of your controller. More technical details on each step Calibration D-Pad type test This is an important step since some USB controllers generate analog events from the D-Pad, and it that case a small calibration must be done for all directions to be recognized. Simply press the RIGHT button on D-Pad first. If it generates analog stick event, then MiSTer will ask to press DOWN as a second stage. Otherwise it will proceed to the next steps if no analog event has been detected. If you are defining keyboard keys for joystick emulation, then simply press the RIGHT arrow key and it will skip Stick steps and jump to D-Pad keys definition. Stick 1 and 2 analog axes If your gamepad has no analog sticks then skip this step via the SPACE key. Otherwise, you need to define them for it to be calibrated and use proper analog to digital mapping. ( Note: Some gamepads like 8bitdo M30 emulate analog stick events on DPAD, so you have to press RIGHT and DOWN for Stick 1! Skip for Stick 2). Note that these definitions have no relation to any specific mapping, it only tells to MiSTer these axes have min-0-max values with 0 as a default position and will be mapped to 2 digital buttons at the both ends. Other analog axes not defined here will be treated as 0-max with only 1 digital button. Virtual D-Pad and Buttons Right,Left,Down,Up Virtual D-Pad directions. You can use an analog stick or even buttons if desired. A,B,X,Y,L,R,Select,Start . Basic buttons, any physical button can be assigned to these. Skip with SPACE if your physical controller is missing some buttons. Alternate layout and Mouse emulation Right,Left,Down,Up (Mouse and Alt) - alternative direction control. If your gamepad has analog stick, then you can assign it here. In cores this alternative control will work in parallel to the one defined in the core. So you will be able to control directions with DPAD(or whatever you ve defined in core) and analog stick. Some games are good to be controlled by stick, other games are good with DPAD. These controls are used for mouse emulation as well, so if you don t have the stick (or don t want to use it), then define DPAD buttons here again. The same sticks defined here will be used for mouse emulation. Mouse Left/Right/Mid Btn - buttons for mouse emulation. If your gamepad has many buttons then you can define separate buttons for mouse only, so when in mouse emulation mode both joystick and mouse buttons will be available at the same time. On reduced gamepads you may define the same buttons used for Btn1..Btn4. Mouse Emu/Sniper - button to switch to mouse emulation. While holding it down gamepad will emulate the mouse. In permanent mouse mode (press OSD button while in temporary mouse mode) this button is used for smaller pointer steps (sniper mode). System and analog stick selection BUTTON OSD - important button used to access OSD menu and some additional functions. Stick X/Y - analog axes. Some cores support or even require analog joystick. This allows you to define exactly which input is used for this. For gamepads this is usually the left stick. Note Keyboard can be used as joystick.

Every electronic equipment exhibits some kind of latency , but it only becomes problematic if this latency causes frames to be missed. A frame is typically 16ms for a system using a 60 frames per second display (i.e. 1/60). Lag is only problematic in a few specific cases: * Some older games were designed to rely on extremely quick response (e.g. Punch Out on NES). * If the latency is different between two players, it could introduce an unfair advantage. * Lag that isn t constant can be an issue on games that require precise movement (most players usually adapts to constant lag). There are three major categories of lag. Input, which involves controllers, mouse, etc, Processing, which would involve buffering in the core, execution or delays in code, and Display which involves the output of the video to your display device. Tip For a more detailed overview of lag and exploration of it, please refer to this page: https://inputlag.science/ Input For input, MiSTer primarily uses USB. The latency of USB depends upon the controller itself, with most higher quality controllers predictably having lower latency. Initial tests indicate that some higher quality USB controllers will only take one or two milliseconds for the core to react. This is extremely dependant on the controller you use, and can\u2019t be quantified as a single number because of this, however the USB stack is performant enough to have 1ms latency which should prevent lag in any noticeable form. Processing This is one core advantage of emulation using FPGAs. Unlike software emulators which go through a cycle of executing, and then waiting for a screen refresh, FPGA cores run in real time, as the original hardware did. This means that cores don\u2019t have CPU bottlenecks to slow them down arbitrarily or require additional large buffers to hold data under most circumstances. Display MiSTer\u2019s two primary display outputs are analog and HDMI. The analog output is driven as the original system would have, with no buffering, and so it will be effectively identical to the latency of a real console. From this point of view, the analog output cannot have any form of lag. When using HDMI output the image must be scaled up to fit the higher resolutions, which requires additional processing. The MiSTer scaler has options which impact its latency. vsync_adjust=2 in the ini file will result in about 4 scanlines of latency, while 0 or 1 will result in about 2 frames of latency, while having the advantage of being more compatible with displays. In addition your own television may introduce more latency, but this varies by device and no definite number can be given on that here. So in summary, if lag is critical to you, the best is to use a recommended USB controller tested by many and a CRT. But even using an HDMI will result in a better experience than many other devices. Video options for HDMI MiSTer offers options in how to configure its HDMI upscaler, making a tradeoff between compatibility and low latency. These can be set in the MiSTER.INI file at the root of the SD card: vsync_adjust=2 is the best option if it is compatible with your TV vsync_adjust=1 is the second best option, but it adds 2 frames of latency vsync_adjust=0 is the lesser option, but the most compatible. 2 frames of latency and less smooth scrolling. Long story short, vsync 0 guarantees 60hz output with an NTSC standard pixel clock, vsync 1 uses a framebuffer but is kept into original vsync (technically, varies the pixel clock per core), and vsync 2 has the original refresh rate and pixel clock of the core (no latency).","title":"What About Lag?"},{"location":"getting-started/inputs/lag-explained/#input","text":"For input, MiSTer primarily uses USB.

To allow for this, MiSTer will ask if you want to setup alternate mappings after defining a gamepad. Alternate mappings are active in parallel and allow two kinds of abilities: map two physical button to the same core button (e.g. alternate button for Start), or map one physical button to two-button combo in the core (e.g. map physical X to thr core s A+B).

This also works with gamepad directions. For example, for games that use Up as a jump button, it is possible to map a physical third button to jump.

Tested on Roadshow TCP/IP, AmiTCP and Miami. AmiTCP provides more complete solution with ftpd daemon. There are many other 3 rd party addons are based on AmiTCP, so it s advised to use this package. Roadshow works ok locally, although i couldn t make DNS work. Probably it needs more settings, but their 20min demo doesn t allow to test and setup it fully. Miami was successfully tested. The Miami settings that worked: use PPP connection via serial.device, set baud rate to 115200, RTS/CTS to on, and enable 8N1. Set modem to nullmodem. Manually enter an IP suitable for your lan ending in 254, e.g. 192.168.1.254. Manually add a DNS server, e.g. 8.8.8.8 for Google DNS. Term v4.7 has been used to test console connection. ao486 . Currently only console connection has been tested using Dos Navigator s integrated Terminal and Kermit 3.15. PPP should work under Win95. DOS tools are here : dos_ftpd.zip C64 . Serial connection. OSD provides an option to switch between PPP and Console on these cores. Both console and PPP are using baud rate 115200 8N1 mode with hardware RTS/CTS flow control for stability. Console connection Using this connection with supported terminal application on FPGA core, you can access the Linux shell and do some file managements or Linux settings if required. No special settings are required of Linux. PPP connection Using this connection core may have internet connection. More important, the core may run ftp daemon and provide access to its filesystem, so you can use FTP client on PC to move the files to/from the emulated system. PPP daemon uses /media/fat/linux/ppp_options (linux\\ppp_options of PC) file. Most likely you don t need to modify it. Recent update assigns IPs automatically. Core gets .254 IP (for example 192.168.1.254). If you want other IP, then modify ppp_options file. For correct PPP work, make sure you see a network icon in Menu core before starting the other core. Otherwise PPP link won t get IPs. If you ve started core earlier, then simply connect the core to PPP and disconnect. Next connection will get correct IP. Or you can switch UART mode in OSD to renew the IP.

If file has size of 100MB - it makes big difference. Similarly, if you want to use a HEX editor, you don t need to download the whole file. Just open it in HEX editor and only small portion will be loaded where you can quickly edit required bytes and save it back quickly. Basically, work with remote files as quick as with local files if you don t need the whole content. With Samba access you can mount VHD files on your PC without downloading! Using utility ImDisk you can mount VHD files as a local disk (mount it as removable store for easier un-mounting). Notes: By default Samba service is not active.

Do It Yourself"},{"location":"hardware/io-board/","text":"IO Board Current Board Revision Revision 6.0 The MiSTer IO Board is an optional expansion. Anatomy The following features will be added to your MiSTer [1] - VGA Connector 1 [2] - 3.5mm Audio Jack with TOSLink [3] - 3 Buttons and 3 Status LEDs [4] - Secondary SD card (for some cores) [5] - FAN for cooling the FPGA [6] - Expansion connector (in the form of USB 3.0 connector, but it s not USB!) [7] - Additional connectors to integrate the MiSTer into cases Secondary SD card Some cores require low-level SD card access. The primary SD card cannot provide low-level access due to an incompatible layout. It is also locked by Linux system from direct access. Thus, I/O board v5.x provides the secondary SD card which is directly connected to FPGA. Linux system doesn t see this card. The layout of the secondary SD card fully depends on core requirements. Usually, it s simple FAT16 format, but some cores may require custom formatting. Schematics Secondary SD card is a simple direct connection between SD connector and DE10-nano GPIOs. It s possible to solder by yourself if whole I/O Board is not required (or older I/O Board is used). Check the schematic if you want to connect it by yourself. Cores with Secondary SD card support Following cores support (but not require, see VHD section) the secondary SD card: BBC Micro MSX Sinclair QL - SD support hasn t been confirmed yet - requires specific ROM. Current ROM doesn t use SD card. TSConf Following cores require the secondary SD card: Sharp X68000 Use VHD files instead of secondary SD card The cores where secondary SD card is optional require VHD image file to replace the SD card in order to work. VHD image is a simple dump of SD card. You can prepare a special SD card for specific core and then make a full backup using a utility such as Win32 Disk Imager . You even can create VHD file without SD card at all. In this case, you can create a smaller VHD file with suitable size in such application as WinImage - save it into IMA format and then rename to VHD. Notes about VHD format Usually FAT16 is required, but some cores can support FAT32 as well. Content of VHD file should be exactly as it is originally required for Secondary SD card. Most (but not all) cores support both non-MBR and MBR types of images. MSX core is known to support only MBR images. Tools like WinImage create only non-MBR images but may open and edit MBR images created somewhere else (like in disk dumper tool from a real prepared SD card). How to use VHD files You can make the image which will be mounted automatically at the start of the core. So, it will look like you have SD card connected at the start. For automatic mounting, you need to name the VHD as CoreID.VHD and place together with RBF file or create the folder * CoreID * and put BOOT.VHD image in that folder. The second option is convenient if you have several VHD files for the core, while the first option is more convenient if only a single file is used. CoreID is the name you see in core s OSD. For example, for Atari 800 core, the auto mounted name will be Atari800.vhd How to use Secondary SD card and VHD VHD file has priority over a real secondary SD card if mounted. Unmount the VHD (press BACKSPACE while choosing VHD file in OSD) in order to use the Secondary SD card. Serial IO The User Port is the port on the IO Board that has the same physical appearance as a USB 3.0 port, but it is merely using a USB 3.0 connector as a means for serial I/O communication. The port could potentially have various uses, but these are features that are currently implemented or upcoming. SNAC (Serial Native Accessory Converter) This essentially means that a system s original controller can be connected (on supported cores) to be used as if they were connected to the original system. This means there is absolutely no lag unless it s native to the original system. Additionally, any original accessories should be compatible within reason (this won t make your original lightguns magically work on a LCD). Currently only one controller port is supported, but (depending on the core) can be swapped between the 1 st and 2 nd controller port in the core s OSD. An adapter will be required that is mostly wire-to-wire plus level shifters to translate the DE-10 Nano s 3.3V IO pins to 5V used in older system s controllers. Cores with support: NES SNES (coming soon) BlisSTer (available at selected stores) This is a combination of a USB hub board that also has a low latency controller interface via the Low-Latency API (LLAPI) that was design to work with the LLAPI (Low level API) in the Bliss-Box adapters. With Bliss-Box style adapters this will allow you connect original controllers for various systems with extremely low latency. The upside of this is that you could technically use any compatible controller with any supported core, so you could use a Genesis controller on the NES core if you really wanted to. The downsize vs SNAC is that this will mostly/only work with controllers, so multi-taps and oddball accessories will generally not be compatible.

Main note: v1 case is discontinued by manufacturer. It just disappeared from the site. This case is still available from distributors such as RS-Online, Sparkfun, but won t last long. So, hurry up if you want to put MiSTer into this case! You may buy it even if you are not sure. You still can use this case for RPi/TB in case if you will change your mind. This is not a budget case. Case is pretty expensive but the only solution on the market. High price of the case doesn t mean good quality, alas. Plastic used on the case is so-so. Connections between plastic details aren t good either. Be careful as some parts are easy to brake (although pi-top site is full of pictures with children). Overall it looks like cheap case, but as has been said, there is no other option on the market to make your own notebook. You can think about adaptation of some (old) notebook case. But it will be more hard and possibly even more expensive. Notebook displays usually have either LVDS or eDP interface while Pi-Top has HDMI. So you will need to find/make a conversion board for notebook display which is not always possible. Keyboard and touchpad in traditional notebook have naked interfaces providing low-level connection while Pi-Top provides USB connection for both keyboard and touchpad. So you will need to make another conversion board for keyboard and touchpad on traditional notebook. Battery management on traditional notebook is on main board, so another board is required while Pi-Top provides integrated HUB board to manage the battery and display power control. So, adaptation of traditional notebook will require pretty large board to convert internal interfaces to those compatible with MiSTer(DE10-nano). Different notebooks have different internals, so it s impossible to make a one board for all notebook cases. And usually even in old thick notebooks there is no much space to fit DE10-nano - especially in height dimension. So, after judge all these difficulties, the only viable option is Pi-Top case. There are 2 versions of Pi-Top cases. This project is targeted to v1 (called as original on Pi-Top site) case only. This version has more space inside and has no specific to RPi holes and places. So, we have pretty relaxed placement of DE10-nano inside. Semi-transparent cover gives good view to all DE10-nano LEDs and doesn t require to drill the holes. v1 uses railed holes to fix the boards, while v2 case uses magnet rails not suitable for this project. Probably it s possible to use v2 case as well, but it will require completely different add-on boards. v2 is available only in childish acid green color which is a main distraction point. You need to be very careful while messing with internals. There is high voltage on HUB board and its connector. It s highly advised to de-solder and remove pin 1 from PiTopHUB connector. It delivers 16.5V and very dangerous for DE10-nano. There is no usage of 16.5V so it s better to remove this pin. Connector on PiTopHUB isn t shrouded and it s very easy to shift it while connecting and fry everything! Many parts on PiTopHUB are powered even when main power of Pi-Top is turned off. It s result of bad Pi-Top design. So, you need to be careful. Don t drop any metallic parts on the board. Avoid to touch the board. Buggy MCU firmware. While developing the boards for Pi-Top i found it s easy to make MCU on PiTopHUB to stick in non-responsible state. And since MCU is always powered (even in power off state) power cycle isn t enough. There are 2 ways to reset the MCU. 1. Remove PiTopHUB and effectively remove the power from MCU. 2. Carefully short the two lower pins on tiny 6-pin connector - this is reset of MCU. New releases required. New releases of Linux, MiSTer binary and Cores are required. Releases after March 02 2018 will be compatible with Pi-Top. Display of Pi-Top supports only one resolution - 1920x1080. So every core will require to support this resolution. Butter-smooth video Although Pi-Top display supports only single resolution, it accepts any (reasonable) pixel clock and refresh rate. So, with this display and automatic VSync adjust option video may have original retro system refresh rate. All scrollers will be very smooth. Required Boards Gerber and PDF files for all boards can be found here Main Board ( Order on PCBWay ) This board has all important parts such as memory, both SD cards and Audio. Memory Both SDRAM (32MB) and SRAM (2MB) are on this board, although SRAM is not supported by any core. There are no plans to use SRAM in foreseen future, so it s advised not to solder SRAM and save the cost. SD Cards Board has the same secondary SD card as on original MiSTer board. Another SD card is original DE10-nano card through micro-SD extender providing convenient access to card as original is in hard to reach place. Audio Audio amplifiers may be soldered directly on board by components, or using Adafruit audio breakout boards by soldering connectors points. MAX98357A has very tiny pads - if you are not sure in your soldering capability, use the breakout boards. The price is about the same as set of components. Although board has places for audio amplifier, it s advised not to solder it. Audio amplifiers gives up to 3.2W per channel and may draw up to 1.2A from 5V source. Due to audio nature, the draw will not be constant and will hammer the DE10-nano power circuit. So, it s advised to solder audio amplifiers on separate Audio board. By default 5V power of audio is connected to 5V of DE10-nano. There is an option to use external 5V supply for audio by cutting tiny cut point near P6 connector and connect external 5V (take from Audio board) source to unload internal DE10-nano power circuit. Notes Due to height limit in Pi-Top case, this board is mounted at some angle. P1 uses standard profile connector while P2 uses high profile connector (same as on standard MiSTer I/O Board). Thus one side of Arduino connector will slightly protrude from this board s cutout while other side will be covered by the board. You need to cut pins on both connectors at the board level before soldering to make sure it won t prevent closing of sliding cover. (pictures are coming) P4(primary card extender) and I2S_FPGA (if you use audio board) are better to be soldered as SMD using exposed pads on the bottom of the board for the same reason.(pictures are coming) Recommended board thickness is 1.2mm . This board thickness is included to total height of the whole construction. Audio Board ( Order on PCBWay ) Using sockets for speakers: Directly wired: Audio amplifiers can be soldered directly on board by components, or using Adafruit audio breakout boards by soldering connectors points. MAX98357A has very tiny pads - if you are not sure in your soldering capability, use the breakout boards. The price is about the same as set of components. Set on-board DE10-nano switches according to picture to enable I2S output to audio board: Besides audio amplifiers, the boards are providing I2C and SPI connections to DE10-nano (through RTC board). I2C is used for battery monitoring. SPI is used for display brightness control. It s also providing power for fan. Fan power circuit has flexible way to adjust the power using diodes and resistors (see schematics). Recommended board thickness is 1.0mm . This board thickness is included to total height of the whole construction. RTC Board ( Order on PCBWay ) RTC v1.3(or higher) is required to provide I2C and SPI connections. You don t need to populate the board if RTC is not required. You may connect I2C/SPI directly to DE10-nano without RTC board using 14-pin cable connector - just follow the RTC schematics. It s better to trim connector pins on the bottom of DE10-nano board to prevent the cable puncture: Recommended board thickness is 1.6mm USB HUB Board ( Order v2 on PCBWay ) ( Order v3 on PCBWay ) You may solder dual USB2-3 socket directly to the board, or (as shown on pictures) solder single socket with other socked hanging on wires to fit some larger USB device (such as 8BitDo receiver) inside. This board provides convenient USB device connections - both internal(3xUSB) and external(1xUSB). Board also provides mini-USB pass-through for console (or USB Blaster if required). This is optional board. You may use any tiny USB HUB to connect devices as you like. There are 2 versions: * v2 - based on 2 FE1.1S chips. This version is enough for most users. SSOP28 chips are relatively easy to align and solder. * v3 - based on FE1.1 (periphery hub) and FE1.1S (Console+Blaster). FE1.1 is MTT USB hub providing high performance for mixed usage when both slow devices like keyboard/gamepad and high performance devices like WiFi or USB storage connected at the same time. FE1.1 uses LQFP48 package which is harder to align and solder. Both versions have 2 Hubs on board. If you are not actively developing FPGA cores, then most likely you don t need to solder the hub on U2 chip. Only solder the hub based on U1 chip and then mUSB1 and the miniUSB tail to P2. Recommended board thickness is 1.0mm . This board thickness is included to total height of the whole construction. LEDs Pi-Top v1 case has large semi-transparent door, so any lights will be visible through. Thus LEDs on DE10-nano are used for indications. Main Board provides the power LED. Buttons Use keyboard to simulate OSD(F12), User(LCtrl-LAlt-RAlt) and Reset(LShift-LCtrl-LAlt-RAlt) buttons. It s possible to use hardware reset button by short press of power button but it requires hardware modifications of DE10-nano. Power button. Pi-Top power button requires about 2 seconds hold to turn the power on/off. If brightness has been changed since power on, then power button requires around 3-4 seconds hold to turn the power off. Cooling Cooling is necessary as the space around the main chip is to small for passive cooling! The construction uses the turbine fan. It takes air from bottom of the case (remove one magnetic plate on the bottom for air flow) and blows to the side under AIO board all the way to hole on the right of PiTop case. It s hard to screw the fan. There are many different fans on the market. Currently used fan just lays unattached - surrounded parts just keep the fan in place. More pictures You need to buy USB-to-barrel short cable to connect the power to DE10-nano board. Optionally AIO board can be covered by black tape for additional protection. AIO board detached: Unused ADC header has been removed from DE10-nano to improve LEDs view. Black tape attached to Ethernet connector is to reduce glow effect. Bonus: v2 consideration This is how bare DE10-nano fits inside v2 case: Cover cannot be closed. Board doesn t fit. Picture shows the maximum closed position of the cover. Probably, after removing the metallic rail road and cutting the plastic ribs, DE10-nano will be able to fit. So, irreversible modification of the case will be required with drilling the holes. Most likely it s possible to use the same AIO and Audio boards. It will require other USB hub board to accommodate RPi holes on the back of the case. Height comparison v1 vs v2: Basically, v2 is a little slimmer on the back and a little thicker on the front. But without side-by-side comparison it s hard to notice the differences. Overall comparison of v2 to v1: * (-) Only green color available. * (+) Slightly better tactile feeling of the case. It s not so slippery as v1. * (+) Wider keyboard and bigger touchpad. * (-) Cannot fit DE10-nano without butchering the case. * (-) Non transparent cover. Cannot see any indication from the board. * (-) Almost no holes (v1 has big holes around hinges), everything is tightly coupled - needs to drill the holes for speakers. Conclusion: use v2 for Raspberry Pi or Asus Tinker Board ;)","title":"Pi-Top (v1)"},{"location":"hardware/assembly/pi-top-v1/#main-note","text":"v1 case is discontinued by manufacturer.

It s not so slippery as v1. * (+) Wider keyboard and bigger touchpad. * (-) Cannot fit DE10-nano without butchering the case. * (-) Non transparent cover. Cannot see any indication from the board. * (-) Almost no holes (v1 has big holes around hinges), everything is tightly coupled - needs to drill the holes for speakers. Conclusion: use v2 for Raspberry Pi or Asus Tinker Board ;)","title":"Bonus: v2 consideration"},{"location":"hardware/assembly/rtc-board-assembly/","text":"NOTE This page is for reference only.

Assemble the Board Soldering Tutorial SDRAM Board v3.1 (by Negative Solution ): Extra slim board notes: Soldering this board is a little tricky. The board has SDRAM chip laid over connector, so connector should be soldered with neither pins nor solder protruding the board. See the picture: How to cut the pins at the same level and prevent them protruding without special equipment? Insert the connector and using sharp flat nippers trim the pins as close to board as possible. Take the standard printer paper and bend it once, so you will get the 2 layers of paper. Insert these 2 layers of paper between the board and connector. Pins of connector will sink to the level (or slightly dipper) of traces. Solder the pins. Remove the paper. Use solder wick to remove the excessive amount of solder, but make sure it s enough solder remains inside the holes, so pins won t be disconnected with mechanical force. Solder the SDRAM chip and other components.","title":"SDRAM Board Assembly"},{"location":"hardware/assembly/sdram-board-assembly/#note","text":"This page is for reference only.

Diagonal inputs did not exist on their systems so they never had to decide how they should be processed. When they are played on any controllers that can have diagonal inputs (i.e. all controllers that s not a 4-way-only joystick), they behave in an unpredictable manner, causing missed or wrong inputs. Danger This should NEVER be used on systems that were not 4-way only. User Options There are three ways to fix this problem. They are mostly personal preference so cores using this can provide a user option on the OSD. Disabled - Does not do anything. Unpredictable outcome. Change Direction - Otherwise known as Prediction , when diagonal input is received, it assumes the new direction is intended so the direction that was pressed later than the earlier direction is processed. This is the most preferred way and recommended for most systems. Stay On Course - The often called Correction is a way to respect the earlier direction and correct it to stay on course while ignoring the new direction in the diagonal input. No Movement - This Clear option assumes the diagonal input is an error, and both input must be stopped to prevent any potential disasters. Some prefer this for games like Tetris. F.A.Q. Does this produce any input latency? No, it simply redirects input to a new module during single clock cycle to send new processed input. How does this work on 4-way-only joysticks? This has zero impact on 4-way-only controllers. Developer Options Enhanced4Way provides the core developer how certain inputs should be handled. These settings are not exposed to the user. 1. UP-DOWN / LEFT-RIGHT SOCD CLEANING - What to do when opposing directions are active at the same time. This is mostly for keyboards and Hitbox controllers. Neutral - Sends no input Force Up/Left - Most SOCD cleaners force this to Up for vertical. This can be set for horizontal and vertical separately. Force Down-Right - Most SOCD cleaners force this to neutral. This can be set for horizontal and vertical separately 2. Perfect Diagonals - An extremely rare occurrence where the player press two or more adjacent directions at the exact same time, making it impossible to predict their intention or correct them. Favor None - Sends no input Favor Horizontal - Only lets the horizontal inputs through, zeroing the vertical movement. Favor Vertical - Only lets the vertical inputs through, zeroing the horizontal movement. Implementation For users, you cannot use this unless the developer of the core implements it. For developers, it s as easy as adding a new status user OSD option and routing your inputs.
